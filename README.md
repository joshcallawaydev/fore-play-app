### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme was chosen to match the asthetics of the site, being a golf web application. The colours are built in Materialize CSS colours.

### Typography

All fonts were taken from Google fonts (https://fonts.google.com/).

- Body/Main Font - Roboto

I chose this font for its readability at all sizes and its good solid structure to match the sites asthetics.

- Backup - Helvetica and Sans Serif

I chose to add backup fonts should there be any problem rendering the imported font and should the user not have functionality for the google font.

### Sizing

I chose REM as the primary unit metric due to its flexability with responsive design. I have also used PX where necessary for absolute sizing.
