# User stories

In effort to improve UX/UI i regularly tested the site functionality and responsiveness. This way I could see UX/UI bugs first hand and deploy changes in accordance with the user stories and UI/UX principles. I also drafted in friends and family to attempt to break the site's viewing experience and functionality.
